# Udiddit

This is a **SQL**-based project, completed in terms of the requirements of
**Udacity's** _SQL_ nanodegree program. This repo contains all the **SQL** code
(which consists of **DQL**, **DDL** and **DML**) necessary for the project. In

## Project Information

**udiddit** has registered users, and these users can post content (be it external
or original content). Other users can vote on these posts by either upvoting
or downvoting them. Users also have the ability to comment on posts. **udiddit**
is currently using a **Postgres** database schema to store all the data relating
to the application.

### Project Task 1
The first task to be completed is the investigation of the existing data structure.
As a data engineer, you are are required to identify any/all potential errors
and issues within the data model, which could include things like the presence
of denormalised data, consistency rules and incorrect indexing.
